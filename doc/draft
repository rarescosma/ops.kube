# Addon: Deploys critical cluster add-ons: kubedns + dashboard.
#
# Orchestration manages the lifecycle of LXC VMs hosting
# the Kubernetes cluster:
# * Create LXC containers for the control and data planes
# * Handles host-based routing (which acts as a MLS)
# * Destroy the control plane or individual workers
#
# The "pre-" phase generates assets for cluster orchestration and later provisioning:
# * Generates a suitable LXC base image and profile
# * Downloads and synchronizes required binaries (kubectl, kubelet, etcd, etc.)
# * Generates TLS credentials
#
# Provisioning deploys, configures and activates role-specific Kube components:
# * Controllers: etcd, kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler.
# * Workers: docker, kubelet and kube-proxy
#
# The binaries are prepared in the "pre-" phase.
